# etesync-server

The missing [`etesync`](https://github.com/etesync/server) server image. The repository does contain a [example `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/etesync/server/blob/master/docker/test-server/Dockerfile), but that is just an example. Also, that image is not published on Docker Hub or any other registry.
