# Unofficial Docker Images

This repository contains the GitHub Actions workflow code for publishing unofficial Docker images. For the projects which do not provide Docker images at all, or for certain platforms. The images are primarily for personal use, but PRs are always welcome.

## List of images

- [`restic-arm64`](./restic-arm64)
- [`giscus`](./giscus)

## Do they work?

The workflow tests if the images work after pushing them. If anything is wrong, please feel free to submit PRs or issues.

## Can I trust you?

Maybe. No changes are intended to the source code. You can see what's happening at the `Actions` tab. If you still can't trust me, you can fork this repository.
